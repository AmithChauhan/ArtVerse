## üì∑ Features and Interfaces

As, Being an artist and creating videos on youtube and Instagram, and other apps. I don't even receive any money except for selling my art to others. So I came up with the idea of ArtVerse where I am earning just by posting my art. In ArtVerse, I am connecting artists, creators, and investors in one place, also in a decentralized manner where Artist art is not art, it is a digital decentralized Art like never before. there is no decentralized platform that connects artists, users, and Investors.
