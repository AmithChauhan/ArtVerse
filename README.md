## ðŸ’¡Inspiration
As, Being an artist and creating videos on youtube and Instagram, and other apps. I don't even receive any money except for selling my art to others. So I came up with the idea of ArtVerse where I am earning just by posting my art. In ArtVerse, I am connecting artists, creators, and investors in one place, also in a decentralized manner where Artist art is not art, it is a digital decentralized Art like never before. there is no decentralized platform that connects artists, users, and Investors.

## âš™ What it does
ArtVerse is a decentralized platform where ARTISTS can put up ARTS as NFTs. These NFTs can then be traded and each time an NFT gets traded, here Artists can pitch their idea and earn money from their idea as well! The main essence of the platform is to uplift Artists as they really do not get enough recognition and monetary benefits or royalties from the currently available sources.

## ðŸ›  How we built it
- For building Frontend, we use React JS and TailwindCss
- Used Flask as a backend to store all the content and updated it in real-time.
- Used different libraries like DesoPy, DesoJS
The blockchain we use for decentralization is Deso

## ðŸ’ª Challenges we ran into
- It is my first time building a decentralized Dapp on Deso all alone working on the backend, frontend, and Smart Contract. 
- It was hard to make a fully responsive and beautiful UI of ArtVerse.

## ðŸ“Œ Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Well, we built a whole social platform in 16 hours!! That's the biggest achievement of this hackathon.
- Able to build the app on Deso that really solves the issue.
- Ourself for trying our best.

## ðŸ“š What we learned
Learned more about Deso. Learned a lot more about Tailwind CSS and responsive designs.

## ðŸ“š What's next for ArtVerse
- Scaling to hundreds of thousands of users and UX improvements!
- Making the code Open Source and engaging different People.
